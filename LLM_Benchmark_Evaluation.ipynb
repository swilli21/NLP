        "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that identifies and extracts subjective information from text to determine whether the writer’s attitude is positive, negative, or neutral. It’s a widely used NLP technique for analyzing text data in various domains, such as customer feedback, social media conversations, product reviews, etc.\n",

        "A pre-trained language model would need to be fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis task. The steps involved might look like:\n",

        "- Dataset preparation: Collect labelled sentiment data (positive, negative, neutral).\n",

        "This is often done after fine-tuning to enhance the model’s performance on sentiment analysis. It involves the following steps:\n",

This has been an emerging trend in the politics of the Republic of Ireland since the 1980s and is almost always the case in Germany on national and state level, and in most constituencies at the communal level. Furthermore, since the forming of the Republic of Iceland there has never been a government not led by a coalition (usually of the Independence Party and one other (often the Social Democratic Alliance). A similar situation exists in the Republic of Ireland; since 1989, no one party has held power on its own. Since then, numerous coalition governments have been formed. These coalitions have been exclusively led by one of either Fianna F\\u00e1il or Fine Gael. Political change is often easier with a coalition government than in one-party or two-party dominant systems.[dubious \\u2013 discuss] If factions in a two-party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals, or even principles, they can be slow to make policy changes, which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans. Still coalition governments struggle, sometimes for years, to change policy and often fail altogether, post World War II France and Italy being prime examples. When one party in a two-party system controls all elective branches, however, policy changes can be both swift and significant. Democrats Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances, as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan. Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011.\",\n          \"There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota. The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, \\\"site use guidelines\\\" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard.

        "This exercise explores how to evaluate language models on Q&A tasks using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Question answering is a challenging NLP task in which models must extract specific answers from provided context passages — a capability essential for search engines, virtual assistants, and information retrieval systems. SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) is a benchmark dataset that contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Questions posed by crowd workers\n",
        "- Context paragraphs from Wikipedia\n",
        "- Answers that are spans of text from the context\n",
        "- Training and validation splits for model development and evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike classification tasks, QA evaluation requires measuring how well a model can locate and extract the exact answer text. Modern QA systems leverage pre-trained language models fine-tuned specifically for extractive question answering. DistilBERT for QA is a lightweight model trained to identify answer spans.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Setting up evaluation:\n",

        "#### Why Evaluating LLMs is still a WIP\n",
        "Leaderboard integrity depends on standardized submission processes such as model registration, standardized evaluation, verification, publication and optional peer review. As we can see, this is very much a work in progress, and a lot depends on the consensus within the community of AI researchers. A persistent challenge in the benchmark-leaderboard ecosystem is the “benchmark chase.” This refers to the fact that often models might be explicitly optimized for benchmark performance, which can lead to overfitting to specific benchmark formats and misalignment with real-world performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Current benchmarks and leaderboards also face representation issues:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Predominance of English-language evaluation\n",
        "- Cultural biases in knowledge and reasoning tasks\n",
        "- Limited coverage of specialized domains\n",
        "- Challenges in measuring emergent capabilities not anticipated during benchmark design\n",
        "- Evaluation Methodology Debates\n",
        "\n",
        "LLM benchmarks and leaderboards form a symbiotic ecosystem that drives progress in the field. Benchmarks provide standardized measurements, while leaderboards track improvements over time and across models. Together, they create competitive pressure that accelerates innovation while establishing common standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, this ecosystem must continually evolve to remain relevant. As models become more capable, benchmarks must become more sophisticated. As societal implications of LLMs grow, evaluation frameworks must expand to incorporate broader considerations of responsible AI. The most useful benchmarks and leaderboards don’t just track capabilities — they shape the direction of research by highlighting what we’ve achieved and what remains to be solved. They serve not just as scoreboards but as roadmaps for the future of artificial intelligence."
